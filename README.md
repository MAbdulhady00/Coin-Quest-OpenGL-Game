- glad: glad is a library that manages OpenGL function pointers. It provides a simple way to load and use OpenGL functions in your application, making it easier to work with the OpenGL API.

- glfw: glfw (OpenGL FrameWork) is a lightweight library for creating and managing windows, handling user input (keyboard, mouse), and managing OpenGL contexts. It provides a simple and cross-platform API for creating OpenGL applications.

- glm: glm is a header-only C++ mathematics library designed for OpenGL. It provides classes and functions for vectors, matrices, transformations, and other mathematical operations commonly used in computer graphics. glm follows the GLSL specification, making it compatible with OpenGL.

- imgui: imgui (Immediate Mode Graphical User Interface) is a graphical user interface library that allows for the easy creation of GUIs within OpenGL applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to create and interact with UI elements, making it useful for in-game interfaces, debug tools, and more.

- sdl: Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) is a cross-platform development library that provides low-level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. SDL simplifies the development of multimedia applications, including games, by abstracting platform-specific details.

- stb: stb is a collection of single-file public domain libraries for C/C++ that provide various useful functions for graphics programming, such as image loading and saving, font rendering, and more. These libraries are lightweight, easy to integrate, and widely used in the game development community.

- tinyobj: tinyobj is a small and easy-to-use C++ library for loading Wavefront OBJ files, which are commonly used to store 3D models and their associated material information. It allows you to load OBJ files into your application and access vertex positions, normals, texture coordinates, and material properties.

- nlohmann json: nlohmann json is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) library for modern C++. It provides a simple and intuitive API for parsing, serializing, and manipulating JSON data.
